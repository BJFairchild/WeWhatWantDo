Randomedia!

Created by Brittan Fairchild, Nick Dunlap, and Stan Luong

We wanted to create an app that would let you compare a list of media that you like to the lists of your friends in order to find media that has enough of a correlation that you might all enjoy it.

Instructions

Start by spinning up a rails server and typing 'npm start' into your console.

Start by creating a new user and then a new group. Once the group has been created, you can invite other users into your group with the invite bar on the left side of the screen.
Next lets add media to our list by clicking 'My Media' at the top of the screen. Here you can add movies, TV shows, books, etc. 
Once you have a list of media, return to the group list by clicking "Groups" at the top of the screen. Once here, you can select the type of media that you'd like to be suggested to you. Click "Get Group Suggestions" to generate a list of media that correlates to each of the group members' unique lists of media. Clicking "Get More Suggestions" will cycle the list. You can click "Description" to get information about each suggested item. You can also click on the play icon to view the embedded trailer for each suggestion, if there is one present.
